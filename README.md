The project aims to build an interactive dashboard using D3.js to explore the "Belly Button Biodiversity" dataset. The dataset catalogs the microbes found in human navels and reveals that a small number of microbial species are present in a significant percentage of people.

The project involves the following steps:

    Reading the data from the samples.json file provided via a URL.
    Creating a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) found in an individual's navel.
    Building a bubble chart that displays each sample, with the size and color of markers representing the sample values and OTU IDs, respectively.
    Displaying the demographic information (sample metadata) of the selected individual.
    Updating all the plots and metadata when a new sample is selected.
